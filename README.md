## 🛠 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Make a .env file from .env.example with your values.
3. Start the backend server with:

   ```bash
   python3 server.py
    ```
    ⚠️ Note: Make sure you're using Python 3 (preferably 3.8 or higher). Running the server with Python 2 will not work.
